This file will be used to add phrase variables to allow
easy customization of various portions of the web server.

The intention is that systems like "In-Game Mail" could easily
be changed to use a different name like "Galactic Inbox" without
needing to change multiple scripts or templates and instead just
one master variable. Of course, default varibesl are included.
